Notes
find the pixel dimensions of a single square.
each square has the area of 85 x 64 pixels
square_dim = pygame.draw.rect(screen, 'blue', (123, 298, 85, 64), 0)
#now to find the center of each of these rectangles
square_center = (square_dim.x + (square_dim.width // 2), square_dim.y + (square_dim.height // 2))
pygame.draw.circle(screen, 'green', square_center, 5)
draw the grid
